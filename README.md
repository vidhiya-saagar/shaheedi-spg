# SPG - User Side

> "This project has been undertaken with the intention to bring _Sri Suraj Prakash_ to the broader audience in a format that is digestible by today's audience of readers that are well versed in the English language." 

This repo is the user-facing side of SPG ([view here](https://spg.dev/chapters)).  Initially released to the public congregation in the month of ਪੋਹ to honour the fallen martyrs of Chamkaur Sahib; it is a work in progress, and we hope to bring more episodes as narrated by the magnificent poet, Kavi Santokh Singh.
