                      A foundational source of inspiration in Sikhi are the
                      sakhis (stories) of the Gurus and their Sikhs. However,

                      inspiration, which in today’s date is read and
                      contemplated amongst the diaspora. Written by Kavi Raaj
                      Bhai Santokh Singh, <i>Suraj Prakash Granth</i> (SPG)
                      serves as an important and influential work of literature.
                      Filled with a rich history, the philosophy of the 10 Guru
                      Sahibs can be explored through the numerous volumes of
                      poetic beauty.

                      western Hindi language in the times preceding the 19th
                      century. SPG is structured in a way that it relates to the
                      rays of the Sun itself; as a way of reflecting the Guru’s
                      glory. SPG ranges to over 1600 angs and consists of 51,820
                      verses written in the form of <i>Dohras</i>,{' '}
                      <i>Chhands</i> and additional sophisticated literary
                      devices. The literary work is broken down into 12{' '}
                      <i>raas</i>’ (months), 6 <i>ruts</i> (seasons) and 2{' '}
                      <i>ayans</i> (solstices) in resemblance to the rising and
                      setting of the sun. It is currently available in the form

                      administered by Bhai Vir Singh and include a detailed dive
                      into the life of Kavi Ji.

                      is the most commonly used historical source for discourse

                      discourse on <i>Sri Suraj Prakash</i> is done every day
                      where a reader (<i>Paathi</i>) reads aloud lines from the

                <h3>The Great Poet</h3>
                <p>
                  Kavi Raaj Bhai Santokh Singh has played an essential role in
                  today’s Sikh world as one of the most renowned scholars of
                  Sikh history and philosophy. Kavi Ji were from the village
                  Noor Di Saraan in the district of Amritsar; born into the
                  house of father Deva Singh and mother Raezadi Kaur. At an
                  early age, Kavi Ji would be sent to obtain <i>vidya</i> under
                  the tutelage of Giani Sant Singh, head Granthi of Sri
                  Harmandir Sahib and a renowned Gurmat scholar. Through the
                  duration of their <i>vidya</i> under Giani Sant Singh, Kavi Ji
                  would learn <i>Braj Bhasha</i>, <i>Brahmvidya</i> and
                  experience the divine; all of the foundational pieces that
                  attributed to their creation (<i>rachna</i>) of such a
                  wondrous Granth. Alongside <i>Braj Bhasha</i>, Kavi Ji would
                  learn a multitude of languages such as Farsi, Sanskrit, and
                  take part in religious discourse with acknowledged scholars of
                  the Sikh and Hindu faith. Throughout their life, Kavi Ji have
                  been described to be a devout Gursikh who would wake in the
                  early hours of the day and dedicate their time to{' '}
                  <i>bhajan</i>, leading on to writing literary works
                  themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kavi Ji spent time in various regions across Punjab teaching{' '}
                  <i>vidya</i> and serving as an advisor to prominent{' '}
                  <i>Maharajas</i> or a <i>kathakaar</i> to the Sangat. Among
                  these travels, Kavi Ji wrote many sophisticated philosophical
                  literary works including the <i>Naam Kosh</i>,{' '}
                  <i>Sri Guru Nanak Prakash</i>, <i>Garab Ganjani Teeka</i>,{' '}
                  <i>Valmiki Ramayana</i> and many others; a testament to the
                  level of knowledge that they had amassed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the latter part of their life, around 1892{' '}
                  <i>Bikrami samat</i> (~1835 Common era), Kavi Ji would begin
                  the wondrous composition of SPG with the help of Sikh
                  scholarly works, support of Maharaja Udai Singh of Kental, and
                  the Guru’s <i>Shaheed Singhs</i> themselves. Kavi Ji would
                  consolidate many various historical accounts of the Guru
                  Sahibs from references including:
                  <ul>

                  Shortly before their passing, Kavi Ji completed the Granth, an
                  embodiment of their life’s efforts, and gave ownership to the
                  Guru Panth for the rights of usage at Sri Harmandir Sahib.
